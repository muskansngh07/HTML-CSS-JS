## All the things I learnt in HTML

### Tags and their use

1. `<!DOCTYPE html>` : Tells the browser that the document is of HTML type.
2. `<html>..</html>` : parent of every tag we use in an HTML document; without it, everything might just not be rendered properly.
3. `<head>..</head>` : Contains all the metadata; Non-visible information.
4. `<title>..</title>` : Contains the name of the web page; kind of child of the `<head>` tag.
