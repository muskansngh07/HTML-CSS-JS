        <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
        <p>It is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is used to build systems that rely on data provided to them.
            Instead of a specific rules to be written for a computer to do its job, the computer is given a large amount of data and it uses 
            algorithms to discover the rules and patterns itself.
