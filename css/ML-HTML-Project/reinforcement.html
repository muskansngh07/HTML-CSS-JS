                    It is a branch of machine learning that focuses on how an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize a reward. It learns
                    from its own experience, essentially through trial and error.

                <h2>☆ How it works?</h2>
                <p>The core of reinforcement learning is a continuous feedback loop between the agent and its surroundings.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Agent</strong>: The learner or decision-maker (e.g., a robot or a software program).</li>
                    <li><strong>Environment</strong>: Everything an agent interacts with (e.g., a game board or a physical room).</li>
                    <li><strong>State (S)</strong>: The current situation or configuration of the environment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reward (R)</strong>: Feedback from the environment (either positive or negative).</li>
                </ol>
                <hr>
                <h2>☆ Key Concepts</h2>
                <h3>1. Exploration vs. Exploitation</h3>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>This is the fundamental trade-off in RL:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Exploration: </strong>Trying new things to see if they lead to better rewards.</li>
                        <li><strong>Exploitation:</strong>This is used when the output is a continuous numerical value. The computer is trying to find a "best-fit line" that represents the relationship between variables.</li>
                     </ul>
                </blockquote>
                <h3>2. The Policy (π)</h3>
                <blockquote>
                    The policy is the "brain" or strategy of the agent. It maps states to actions, telling the agent, "If you are in state S, you should take action A."
                </blockquote>
                <h3>3. The Value Function (V or Q)</h3>
                <blockquote>
                    While rewards are immediate, the Value Function predicts the long-term total reward an agent can expect from a specific state or action. This helps the agent understand that a small reward now might lead to a huge loss later, or vice versa.
